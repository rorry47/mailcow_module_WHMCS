# *ATTENTION!*
You do not need to create an administrator in MailCow, just generate an API key with read and write rights and register it in the server settings. This will be enough for the module to work.

# Important nuances
I don't setting tariffs etc. because I didn't need it.So, all options, the creation of a domain administrator and domains is written in the file: `config.php` !
Namely: 
```php
  $SET_aliases = 100;
  $SET_MMAILBOXES = 10;
  $SET_MAILBOXQUOTA = 1024;
  $SET_DEFQUOTA = 1024;
  $SET_MAILBOXES = 10240;
  $SET_rl_value = 10;
  $SET_rl_frame = "s";
```

That's all I wanted to say. Good luck. ðŸ˜‰
